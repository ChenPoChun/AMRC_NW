# Plan
Replacing existing serverReceiver_print with a Python socket and using Library MatPlotLib to plot the chart

# Building blocks
1. Python script to receive and print with proper result/format compared with serverReceiver_print
2. Python code to use MatPlotLib to plot line charts with status code
3. integrate block 1 and block 2

# Status Update

## 13/Dec
- Install Wireshark to decode the message

## 15/Dec
- Able to aggregate packets; however, can not decode the message and needs help in message decoding.

## 19/Dec
- Two files are created and tested. These are (1) LineChart.py and (2) SrvPrint.py
- LineChart.py: Python3 Script to draw line charts and scatter gots to represent the message received from remote. Due to decoding issues, the randomly generated message replaces the real-time data feed.
- SrvPrint.py: Python3 Script to receive packet generated by clientSender_fn. But packets still need to be decodable.

# Howto Run
## Tested Platform
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04.1 (VirtualBox), MacOS 12.7.1 (X86_64)
- Python: 3.9.5(MacOS) 3.10.12(Ubuntu)

## prerequisites
- Install pip3: sudo apt update & sudo apt install python3-pip
- Install MatPlotLib: pip3 install -U matplotlib

## How to run
- LineChart.py: python3 LineChart.py
- SrvPrint.py: python3 SrvPrint.py
